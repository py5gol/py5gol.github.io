  <h1>Biography</h1>

    <p>My name is Roberto Santos. In September of 2013, I started my PhD in Geospatial Science at the University of Nottingham. I am a member of the Doctoral Training Partnership with the Crops For Future (CFF). I was fortunate to receive a scholarship from the University of Nottingham and CAPES (a Brazilian funding agency).</p>

    <p>My research includes an investigation of how does geography reflect or affect the genetic variation of Bambara groundnut. The Bambara groundnut is an underutilised legume cultivated in Africa and Asia. It is a multidisciplinary research that involves geospatial science, agriculture and genetics. It is a challenging but also rewarding topic and of great importance if we want face the challenge of feed almost 9 billion people by 2050 in a scenario of climate change while keeping agricultural biodiversity.</p>

    <p>My academic background includes a BSc. in Mathematics and a MSc. in Applied Computing. I have experience in many projects including geospatial opensource tools, meteorology, environment and agriculture.</p>

    My PhD does explore the connections between genetic variation and the spatial distribution of semi-domesticated crops human-altered landscapes.

    <h4>How does Geography affect or reflect the genetic variation of the Bambara groundnut?</h4>
    <p>The Bambara groundnut is an underutilised legume cultivated in Africa and Asia. It is a multidisciplinary research that involves geospatial science, agriculture and genetics. It is a challenging but also rewarding topic and of great importance if we want face the challenge of feed almost 9 billion people by 2050 in a scenario of climate change while keeping agricultural biodiversity.</p>

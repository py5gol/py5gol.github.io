I completed the program a few years ago (before being a father), and even ran a few 5k and 10k runs. My top event was the Robin Hood half marathon in 2015. Well, since then, I haven't done much exercise, but once in a while, when I go for a short run, I immediately remember how much I like the post-run side effects. It is good for my body, and it is super good for my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that is it - I wanted to share that I back, and hopefully I will keep going. This also seems a good theme to start the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I will be swamped attending the Health Data Research UK summer school! I went last year to St Andrew's, and it seems a long time ago when we used to meet people face to face. But, I am happy with the online version; otherwise, it is unlikely I would be able to attend this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers, and see you around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have mixed professional experience, working as a software developer after my degree in Mathematics. A few years later, I returned to academia to pursue a master’s in Computer Science, followed by a PhD in Geography at Nottingham. Having worked a couple of years as a research fellow, mainly doing software development, I immediately took the opportunity to join the Digital Research Service as a Research Software Engineer. In the last couple of years, I have been working more with Health Data, the Tissue Directory and Coordination Centre, and the BBRMI-ERIC, a European research infrastructure for biobanking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

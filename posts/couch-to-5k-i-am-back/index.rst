Yesterday I restarted the `Couch to 5k program`_. I completed the program a few years ago (before being a father), and even ran a few 5k and 10k runs. My top event was the Robin Hood half marathon in 2015. Well, since then, I haven't done much exercise, but once in a while, when I go for a short run, I immediately remember how much I like the post-run side effects. It is good for my body, and it is super good for my mental health.

So, that is it - I wanted to share that I back, and hopefully I will keep going. This also seems a good theme to start the blog.

This week I will be swamped attending the `Health Data Research UK summer school`_! I went last year to St Andrew's, and it seems a long time ago when we used to meet people face to face. But, I am happy with the online version; otherwise, it is unlikely I would be able to attend this year.

Cheers, and see you around.

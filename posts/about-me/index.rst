I work for the University of Nottingham as a team lead of research software engineers and data scientists.

I have mixed professional experience, working as a software developer after my degree in Mathematics. A few years later, I returned to academia to pursue a masterâ€™s in Computer Science, followed by a PhD in Geography at Nottingham. Having worked a couple of years as a research fellow, mainly doing software development, I immediately took the opportunity to join the Digital Research Service as a Research Software Engineer. In the last couple of years, I have been working more with Health Data, the Tissue Directory and Coordination Centre, and the BBRMI-ERIC, a European research infrastructure for biobanking.

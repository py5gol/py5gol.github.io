I completed the program a few years ago (before being a father), and even ran a few 5k and 10k runs. My top event was the Robin Hood half marathon in 2015. Well, since then, I haven't done much exercise, but once in a while, when I go for a short run, I immediately remember how much I like the post-run side effects. It is good for my body, and it is super good for my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that is it - I wanted to share that I back, and hopefully I will keep going. This also seems a good theme to start the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I will be swamped attending the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/events/save-the-date-health-data-research-uk-summer-school-2020/"&gt;Health Data Research UK summer school&lt;/a&gt;! I went last year to St Andrew's, and it seems a long time ago when we used to meet people face to face. But, I am happy with the online version; otherwise, it is unlikely I would be able to attend this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers, and see you around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>running</category><guid>https://example.com/posts/couch-to-5k-i-am-back/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 20:30:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

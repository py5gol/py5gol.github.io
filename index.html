        <h4>Hi there!</h4>
        <p>This is Roberto's home page (yeah, you probably already know this, but I am old school and like to keep things clear). Here you can find information about the research topics I am interested or working on, the software development stuff in general (mostly web mapping and GIS) and a bit more about me. From time to time I try to write a post but I haven't been very successfully in this enterprise.</br>Thanks for your time and see you around!
        <p>Roberto</p>
